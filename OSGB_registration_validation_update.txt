# OSGB Registration Validation Update (June 2025)

## What Changed?
The backend now validates OSGB registration fields against the official OSGB list (osgb-lists.xlsx) during registration. This ensures only officially recognized OSGBs can register.

## What Does the Frontend Need to Know?
- **API request body:** No changes. Continue sending:
  - company_name
  - tax_number
  - address
  - tax_office
  - osgb_id
  - phone
  - email
  - password
  - city
  - district

- **New error messages:**
  - If a field does not match the official list, the backend returns a 400 error with a specific message:
    - `INVALID_OSGB_ID`: OSGB ID not found in the official list.
    - `INVALID_COMPANY_NAME`: Company name does not match the official record.
    - `INVALID_CITY`: City does not match the official record. (Message includes the expected value)
    - `INVALID_DISTRICT`: District does not match the official record. (Message includes the expected value)

- **Example error response:**
```json
{
  "error": "INVALID_CITY",
  "message": "City does not match the official record. Expected: Ankara"
}
```

## Action Required
- FE should display these error messages to the user during registration if received.
- No changes needed to the registration form or request body.
