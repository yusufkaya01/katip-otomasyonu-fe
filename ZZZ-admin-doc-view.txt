Admin OSGB APIs for FE integration
==================================

1. GET /api/admin/osgbs/missing-tax-info
   - Returns all companies (OSGBs) missing tax_office or tax_number.
   - Each item includes: osgb_id, company_name, license_key, customer_id, email, and signed S3 URLs for vergiLevhasi and yetkiBelgesi docs.
   - Security: Requires admin JWT and admin API key.
   - Example response:
     [
       {
         "osgb_id": "OSGB-1234",
         "company_name": "ABC OSGB",
         "license_key": "XYZ123",
         "customer_id": "CUST001",
         "email": "abc@osgb.com",
         "vergiLevhasiUrl": "https://...",
         "yetkiBelgesiUrl": "https://..."
       },
       ...
     ]

2. POST /api/admin/osgbs/update-tax-info
   - Updates tax_office and tax_number for a company (OSGB) by customer_id.
   - Body: { customer_id, tax_office, tax_number }
   - Security: Requires admin JWT and admin API key.
   - Returns: { success: true } on success, error otherwise.

FE Flow:
- Call GET to list all companies needing tax info and get doc links.
- Show docs to admin, let them enter tax info, then call POST to update.

Notes:
- S3 signed URLs are valid for 15 minutes.
- If a doc is missing, the URL may return 403 (file not found).
- All endpoints are protected; FE must send both admin JWT and API key.
